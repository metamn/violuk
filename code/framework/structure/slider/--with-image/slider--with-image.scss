// Slider with image
//
// Experimental :
//
// In a slider without image everything is ok. With an image we should specify the exact dimensions of the image.
// Otherwise the slider will truncate it.
// The intrinsic ratio mixin is a way to define the dimensions of an image in a fully responsive way.
//
// When using the intrinsic ratio all images must have exactly the same dimensions and they must have the exact aspect ratio
//
// To create 2x, retina landscape and portrait screenshots with this monitor:
// - landscape 16:9 - screenshot 1920x1080 (2x), resize to 960 for 1x
// - portrait 3:4 - screenshoot 900x1200 (2x), resize to 450x for 1x
//
// => with this monitor cannot be created fullscreen retina screenshots
// => to have a monitor for @2x landscape and portrait screenshots we would need a 3840x2160 monitor with rotation capability
// => it's a 4K/UHD monitor ~500usd from Asus: http://www.amazon.com/PB287Q-Monitor-3840X2160-Resolution-28-Inch/dp/B00KJGY3TO/ref=sr_1_2?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1455668007&sr=1-2&keywords=asus&refinements=p_89%3AAsus%2Cp_n_feature_three_browse-bin%3A12659079011
//
// The best we can have without retina support is:
/*
    {
      "name": "mobile",
      "width": "384"
    },
    {
      "name": "tablet",
      "width": "768"
    },
    {
      "name": "laptop",
      "width": "1440"
    },
    {
      "name": "desktop",
      "width": "1920"
    }
*/
// To have 2x, retina friendly images:
// - landscape 16:9 - 2x: 3840x2160 => 1920x1080
// - portrait 3:4 - 2x: 1536x2048 => 768x1024
